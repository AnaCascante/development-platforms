# Sanity.io Case Study

Sanity.io is a platform that enables companies of all sizes to create remarkable digital experiences. It provides a single source of truth for content, aiding in the development of innovative digital campaigns. Sanity.io’s strengths lie in its excellent integration with popular programming languages and frameworks, providing a seamless experience for developers. Its powerful image pipeline and support for GraphQL make it a versatile tool for content management. Additionally, it boasts a large library of official and custom plugins, further enhancing its capabilities.

One of the main weaknesses is the lack of multi-language support, which is only available through plugins. This could potentially limit its usability for global teams. Additionally, with a high number of requests and responses, a paid tariff becomes necessary, which could be a barrier for smaller organizations. The time to set up a project can be slower than some of the competitors. Lastly, there’s a dependency on Sanity.io when developing data for a website, which could limit flexibility.

## Comparison with Competitors

Sanity.io is one of a large library of CMS providers. In this case study we have chosen to look a bit closer and compare sanity with two of their more popular competitors, Strapi and Contentful.
All three platforms share a content-first approach, providing flexibility to developers by allowing them to use their preferred programming languages and frameworks. They all focus on delivering content across multiple channels.

### Differences.

Strapi: Strapi sets itself apart as an open-source platform, giving developers more control over the backend storage and admin interface. It allows for the creation of custom APIs quickly and easily, with the ability to define the structure of the data according to project requirements. Strapi also features a secure and intuitive admin panel that enables non-technical users to manage content without needing to interact with the codebase.

Sanity.io: Sanity.io differentiates itself with real-time collaboration features and a customizable editing environment. It has a powerful image pipeline that handles image metadata extraction on upload and transformations in front-end usage. Additionally, Sanity.io provides a globally distributed CDN, ensuring fast and efficient delivery of content.

Contentful: Contentful is known for its robust set of tools for enterprise-scale projects. It provides a user-friendly interface for content creators to manage content without needing technical skills. Moreover, Contentful supports multi-language content for international audiences.

In the world of CMS there is a vast amount of options. Each with unique features that set them apart. The choice between these platforms depends on the specific needs and circumstances of the project. Each platform has its own strengths and weaknesses, and potential users should consider these factors when deciding which CMS is the right fit for their needs.
